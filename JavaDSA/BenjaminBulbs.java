// Specifically, bulb number k is toggled once for each of its divisors(factors). 

// Therefore, the total number of toggles for bulb k equals the number of divisors of k.â€‹

// A key observation is that only perfect squares have an odd number of divisors. 
// This is because divisors typically come in pairs (e.g., for 12: (1,12), (2,6), (3,4)), but in the case of a perfect square like 9, one of the divisors (3) is repeated, resulting in an odd count.
